Let me start by saying I love github. It's a brilliant idea to combine
social networking with best-in-class tools for source code
management. But the more I use github, the more awesome features I
discover. The latest is this one -- github's user pages. Ok, fine, you
can post some html pages to your github account and have them
displayed to the world. That's OK, but it's easy enough to host a web
page. Where this gets even cooler is that github has a nice blog-aware
static site generator [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) built
in so that one can generate nice bloggy web posts without a lot of
hassle. Brilliant.
